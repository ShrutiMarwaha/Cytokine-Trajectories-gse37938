# Cytokine-Trajectories-gse37938
IL-1b, IL-10 and IFNg trajectories in Helicobacter pylori infection. We extracted and analyzed time-series data for IL-10, IFNγ, IL-1β from gse37938 dataset. For a given probe, median of its expression values was calculated for each time point. The median values for both control and H.pylori infection were plotted against time to study their trajectory. Probes with two or more missing values for more than one time point, were ignored. To address the problem of probe selection, median value was taken for probes with same Genbank ID (GB_list ID ) while probes with different Genbank ID were analyzed separately.
